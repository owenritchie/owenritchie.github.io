      "text": "I’m Owen, an engineer with a love for data, stats & maps. In Grade 10 I took a C# class, which allowed me to make really horrible video games, later leading me to choose CS as my major for university. Since then, I’ve narrowed down my focus to what interests me the most: the design, application & presentation of data. From the beginning of university, I’ve had a chance to apply my curiosity in various streams, analyzing geospatial surveys of salmon eggs on a team of 12 at Poisson Consulting Ltd. to determine egg mortality rates, building Global Affairs Canada a Country Indicators dashboard to determine the effectiveness of international aid grants, and most recently, architecting a full-scale database migration from Postgres to GCP at Kinaxis."

      "text": "When I’m not working, I’m probably spending my time hiking, skiing, or playing sports—pretty much anything that will keep me active! I also enjoy playing music, which I’ve been doing on the violin since I was 7. In 2023 I took a trip to Eastern Europe, where I was lucky enough to perform with my Montreal orchestra in front of thousands in competitions in Bratislava & Vienna! Photography is also a big hobby for me, which I’ve been doing since I was 11 or 12. If you want to check out a few pictures, I put some in the \"Art\" tab. Thanks for stopping by!"
